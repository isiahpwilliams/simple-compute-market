"""The api family's bearer gate (Python).

A seller-side component that gates a downstream HTTP app on prepaid
credits: it extracts the bearer key, verifies it against the family
authority (short-TTL cache), meters each request by consuming credits
(synchronously near exhaustion, optionally batched above a low-balance
threshold), and maps a drained key to a 402 whose body points at the
listing to buy more (the re-purchase loop). The authority alone
verifies keys and keeps the accounts.

The behavioral contract — status codes and machine-readable bodies —
is shared with the TypeScript and Rust gates and pinned by the
conformance fixtures under ``domains/apicredits/middleware/conformance``.
