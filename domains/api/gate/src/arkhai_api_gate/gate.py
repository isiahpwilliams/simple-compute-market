"""Framework-neutral token gate.

One ``TokenGate`` instance backs any number of web adapters (the ASGI
middleware in ``asgi.py`` is the first). It owns the verify cache, the
per-key balance estimate, the batched-charge accumulator, and the
background flush loop; an adapter only translates a request's
``Authorization`` header into ``authorize(...)`` and a ``GateDecision``
back into an HTTP response. ``authorize`` is ``verify`` then ``charge``; a
composition that must check a verified key before charging it calls the two
itself.

Decision vocabulary (status + machine-readable body) is identical
across languages — it is the behavioral contract the conformance
fixtures pin (``domains/apicredits/middleware/conformance``).
