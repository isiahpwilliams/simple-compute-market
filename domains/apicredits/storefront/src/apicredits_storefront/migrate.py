"""The storefront's migration chain and its command, ``apicredits-storefront-migrate [--check]``.

The chain is the family selling library's under this storefront's table prefix,
named for this storefront. The command loads the layered settings alone, so it
runs without the storefront's chains or identity; Compose runs it before
``serve`` in the storefront's container, and ``make migrate`` runs it for local
development.
