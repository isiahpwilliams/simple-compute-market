"""The inference service's migration command and its startup check, over the family authority's chain.

The chain and its refusals are the authority library's and are tested there.
Here: the installed command is this root's, it reads this service's settings
without its signing credential, and the composition refuses a database the
command has not migrated.

External boundary: file-backed SQLite in a temp directory; the command runs
through its entry point with the service's own settings loader.
