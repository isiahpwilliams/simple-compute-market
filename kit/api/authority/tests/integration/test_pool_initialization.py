"""Every pool the authority holds declares advertisement and backing.

The authority seeds the profile's Resource Pool outside pool administration,
with the declarations the profile states, and refuses to start with a pool
that lacks them. No migration writes a pool.

External boundary: SQLAlchemy against file-backed SQLite in a temp directory,
migrated by the authority's chain and initialised as a root's startup does.
