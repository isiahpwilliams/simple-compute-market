# Implementation Tasks

Sections are ordered by real dependency and sized to land in roughly a day each.
Sections 1–4 are pure vocabulary and tests with no runtime, deployment, or
packaging effect; Section 5 touches the registry image; Section 6 packages.
Nothing here starts a service or changes API credits.

**Decision gates.** Both gates this change carried are closed and recorded in
`design.md`: 7.1, model identity (decided 2026-09-21, revised 2026-09-24 to a
seller-asserted identifier with a SHOULD derivation rule); and 7.2, credit
denomination (decided 2026-09-24: one credit is one base unit of the settlement
asset). The tasks remain as the record; no open gate remains in this change.

## 1. Domain identity and listing vocabulary

- [x] 1.1 Confirm by inspection, before writing anything, that `design.md`'s
      "Context" table still holds on the target branch: no `inference` identity,
      schema, or filter specification exists; `consume` still takes a variable
      `amount`; the digest strings in `credits_client.py` and `keys_model.py`
      are still literal; `RateValue.per` is still a free string. Record drift in
      `design.md` rather than working around it.
- [x] 1.2 Create `domains/inference/` with `__init__.py`, `pyproject.toml`
      (`arkhai-inference-domain`, hatchling, `force-include` of every module as
      the API-credits domain wheel does), and a `tests/` root. Depend on
      `arkhai-core`, `arkhai-kit-identity`, `arkhai-kit-policy`, `pydantic`.
- [x] 1.3 `domains/inference/src/arkhai_inference/listings/models.py`: `INFERENCE_KIND =
      "inference.v1"`, `INFERENCE_OFFERING_MODE = "inference"`, and the
      `InferenceModelCard` model (`listing_resource` payload) with `model_id`
      (non-empty; characters restricted to what a filter path can carry, no
      format beyond that), `artifact_ref` (non-empty, any scheme including
      private ones), `artifact_digest` (optional, `sha256:` hex),
      `display_name` (optional), `model_owner` (optional marketplace
      principal), `provenance` (required, `self-hosted` | `resold`),
      `attestation` (optional `{kind, schema_version, payload}` envelope, opaque),
      `served_model_name`, `model_family`, `context_length` (positive int),
      `max_completion_tokens` (optional positive int),
      `architecture` (`modality`, `tokenizer`, `instruct_type`),
      `supported_parameters` (list of non-empty strings), `quantization` as an
      enumeration (`none`, `fp16`, `bf16`, `fp8`, `int8`, `int4`, `awq`,
      `gptq`), `endpoint` (`base_url`,
      `openapi_url`, `api_style` literal `openai.v1`), `rate_card`
      (Section 2's model), `capacity_site_id`, `resource_id`, and
      `offering_mode` pinned to `inference`. `extra="forbid"`. Include the
      `coerce_resource_dict` and `resource_is_inference` helpers on the
      API-credits pattern.
- [x] 1.3a `domains/inference/src/arkhai_inference/listings/identity.py`: `derive_model_id(...)`,
      a pure function implementing the derivation rule — public upstream owner
      and repository lowercased with revision, branch, and quantization
      suffixes stripped; the owner's namespace for private weights; the
      fine-tuner's for a fine-tune — plus focused tests that two independent
      inputs for the same weights derive the same identifier and that the
      three suffix kinds are stripped. Sellers and the seller path call it; the
      card does not require it.
- [x] 1.4 `domains/inference/src/arkhai_inference/schema.py`: `InferenceListing` (kind,
      `listing_resource`, `accepted_escrows`, `settlement_options`, `demands`)
      with the same before-validator that normalizes a wheel-boundary model back
      to its wire form, duplicate-option-id rejection, and the required-field
      rejection the spec's "One listing is one served model" scenario names.
- [x] 1.5 Focused tests (`tests/test_listing_models.py`): a complete card
      validates; each comparison field missing is rejected with the field named;
      `offering_mode` other than `inference` is rejected; `api_style` other than
      `openai.v1` is rejected; a listing round-trips through JSON text as the
      storefront's SQLite path stores it; a card without `provenance` or with a
      value outside the enumeration is rejected; a card with a `quantization`
      outside the enumeration is rejected; two cards sharing one `model_id`
      with different `artifact_ref`, `quantization`, and rate cards both
      validate independently; a card with and without the `attestation`
      envelope validate identically; a card naming a `model_owner` validates.

Done 2026-09-27: premises re-verified on `dev` at `29b84d82` with no drift;
`domains/inference/src/arkhai_inference/listings/{models,identity}.py`, `schema.py`; 56 focused
tests. `model_id` admits uppercase by design (seller-asserted); `resource_id`
is optional on the card as on the API-credits resource, the publication path
sets it. The rate card model landed here because the card requires it.

## 2. Rate card and pricing arithmetic

- [x] 2.1 `domains/inference/src/arkhai_inference/listings/models.py`: `InferenceRateCard` with
      `prompt_credits_per_million`, `completion_credits_per_million`
      (non-negative int, required), `request_credits` (non-negative int, default
      0), `cached_prompt_credits_per_million` and `image_credits_per_unit`
      (optional non-negative int) — all denominated in base units of the
      listing's settlement asset. Strict integer validation: `bool`, `float`,
      and numeric strings are rejected, matching `checked_credit_total`'s
      posture in the API-credits pricing module.
- [x] 2.2 `domains/inference/src/arkhai_inference/listings/pricing.py`: `selected_unit_price` and
      `extract_unit_price_from_order` accepting `per: credit` with a value of
      exactly `1` and refusing any other value or unit; the reference payment
      equals `quantity`, with the uint256 overflow guard;
      `determine_strategy_from_order` returning `maximize` for inference
      listings. Copied from the API-credits module and narrowed, not imported.
- [x] 2.3 Focused tests (`tests/test_pricing.py`): a unit rate scales to
      `quantity`; a per-credit rate other than one is rejected; `per: hour` and
      `per: token` rejected; overflow rejected; a listing with no advertised rate
      prices at one and a configured minimum other than one is refused; the rate card has no effect on the purchase price
      (spec: "Purchase is priced in settlement-asset base units").

Done 2026-09-27: `listings/pricing.py`; 23 tests. The hidden-reserve fallback
has no meaning under a fixed unit rate, so a configured minimum is admitted only
when it is one; task 2.3's text was amended to match.

## 3. Provision intent, negotiation carriers, and codecs

- [x] 3.1 `domains/inference/src/arkhai_inference/negotiation/terms.py`: `InferenceProvisionTerms`
      (`kind: inference.v1`, `version: 1`, payload `{quantity ≥ 1, key: {mode,
      key_id?}}`) and `make_inference_provision_terms`, copied from the
      API-credits module with the kind changed. State in the module docstring
      that the shape is shared by design and that kit ownership is decided by
      `extract-access-issuance-kit`.
- [x] 3.2 `domains/inference/src/arkhai_inference/schema.py`: `InferenceMessage`, `InferenceTerms`,
      `InferenceMaterialization` (adds the pinned `rate_card`), `InferenceReceipt`,
      `InferenceResult`, each `extra="forbid"`, each carrying `kind:
      inference.v1`, with the same joint-presence rule for settlement selection
      and canonical principals API credits enforces.
- [x] 3.3 `domains/inference/src/arkhai_inference/domain_runtime.py`: `INFERENCE_MARKET_DOMAIN =
      MarketDomainContract(identity=DomainIdentity("inference.v1"),
      contract_version=MARKET_DOMAIN_CONTRACT_VERSION, codecs=...)` and
      `market_domain()`.
- [x] 3.4 Conformance: `tests/test_domain_conformance.py` runs
      `assert_domain_conformance` with one valid and one invalid example per
      codec, including a materialization whose `rate_card` is absent (rejected)
      and one whose card is fractional (rejected).
- [x] 3.5 Focused tests for provision intent: quantity below one, existing key
      without `key_id`, wrong kind, wrong version.

Done 2026-09-27: `negotiation/terms.py`, the five carriers in `schema.py`,
`domain_runtime.py`; the contract passes `assert_domain_conformance` with an
empty capability set; 24 tests including eleven invalid-input codec cases.

## 4. Usage record, charge derivation, and evidence

- [x] 4.1 `domains/inference/src/arkhai_inference/usage/models.py`: `UsageOutcome` literal
      (`completed`, `cancelled`, `failed`), `InferenceUsageRecord` (`model_id`,
      `key_id`, `request_id`, `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`,
      `cached_prompt_tokens`, `image_units`, `outcome`; non-negative ints;
      `extra="forbid"`), and `derive_charge(record, rate_card) -> int`
      implementing the ceiling formula from `design.md` with zero for `failed`.
      Integer arithmetic only: compute the sum as a rational over `10**6` and
      take the ceiling without floats.
- [x] 4.2 Focused tests (`tests/test_usage.py`): the two spec scenarios
      (cancelled after 400 tokens → 1 credit; failed → 0); exact-million
      boundaries; all-zero record with a floor; cached tokens priced separately
      when a cached rate is present and ignored when absent; a property-style
      test that `derive_charge` never returns a float and never underflows.
- [x] 4.3 `domains/inference/src/arkhai_inference/usage/evidence.py`: `InferenceUsageEvidenceBodyV1`
      (protocol `arkhai.inference.usage-evidence.v1`, schema version `1`,
      `domain: inference`, the record, the pinned card, the derived charge,
      `grant_id`, `fulfillment_id`, `issuer`, and an optional opaque
      `attestation` envelope that verification ignores) with canonical-JSON
      digest and signing/verification helpers on the pattern of the API-credits
      issuance evidence module. Copied and renamed, not imported.
- [x] 4.4 Canary test (`tests/test_usage_evidence.py`): construct evidence with
      a sentinel bearer secret, prompt text, and completion text available to
      the producing code and assert none appears in the canonical bytes;
      verification rejects a tampered charge and an untrusted signer.

Done 2026-09-27: `usage/{models,evidence}.py`; 29 tests including the
secret/prompt/completion canary. The request charge is added to the ceiling of
the token sum, as the requirement and `design.md` state; the spec scenario's
worked number was corrected from 1 to 2. Cached tokens with no cached rate
contribute nothing, as the formula states.

## 5. Registry filter specification

- [x] 5.1 `domains/inference/registry/filter-spec.yaml`, version 1, `schema: {id:
      inference, version: 1}`. `listing_shape` requires `listing_id`,
      `listing_resource`, `storefront_url`, and inside `listing_resource`
      requires `model_id` (non-empty), `artifact_ref`, `provenance` (`enum`),
      `served_model_name`, `context_length`,
      `quantization`, `architecture.modality`, `supported_parameters`,
      `endpoint.base_url`, `rate_card.prompt_credits_per_million`,
      `rate_card.completion_credits_per_million`, and `offering_mode`
      (`const: inference`). Settlement-option and accepted-escrow shapes copied
      from the API-credits specification. `quantization` is an `enum`. The
      `attestation` envelope is admitted by shape and declared by no filter.
      State in the `model_id` field description that the domain's derivation
      rule is a SHOULD, that a registry operator may narrow the field to an
      `enum` or pattern by policy, and that the registry never mints or
      resolves identifiers.
- [x] 5.2 Filters: `model_id`, `model_family`, `quantization`, `modality`
      (`$.listing_resource.architecture.modality`), `supported_parameter`
      (`$.listing_resource.supported_parameters[*]`), and `provenance` as `in`,
      fail-on-missing for required paths; `context_length_min` as `range` lower
      bound; `prompt_credits_max` and `completion_credits_max` as `range` upper
      bounds over the rate card's base-unit integers, each declaring
      `requires: [settlement_asset]` so the registry refuses an unpaired
      bound; no filter over
      `attestation`; `offering_mode` as `in`, fail-on-missing; the
      `token`, `token_exclude`, `settlement_mechanism`, `settlement_asset`,
      `funding_profile`, and `funding_interaction` projections verbatim from the
      API-credits specification.
- [x] 5.3 `core/registry/tests/unit/test_filter_spec.py`: add
      `test_repo_inference_spec_loads` beside `test_repo_api_credits_spec_loads`,
      asserting schema identity `inference` version 1, that every filter path
      resolves against a sample listing built from Section 1's model, that a
      listing without `provenance` is refused at validation, and that no filter
      declaration names the `attestation` path.
- [x] 5.4 `core/registry/Dockerfile`: `COPY domains/inference/registry/filter-spec.yaml
      ./filter-spec-inference.yaml` in the builder stage and the matching
      `COPY --from=builder` in the runtime stage, beside the API-credits lines.
- [x] 5.5 **Integration.** Publish a valid inference listing to a registry
      started with `REGISTRY_FILTER_SPEC_PATH=/app/filter-spec-inference.yaml`
      through the registry client; query each filter; confirm a listing under
      `offer_resource` is rejected and a listing missing `rate_card` is
      rejected. Use the existing registry integration fixtures.

Done 2026-09-27: `registry/filter-spec.yaml`, two `COPY` lines, the unit load
test, and `core/registry/tests/integration/test_inference_spec.py` (both
sellers found by every filter; the dry run refuses each malformed card naming
the field; the retired key is refused at publish). Registry unit 105, integration
126. The image was built and carries all three specifications. Finding: the
registry does not enforce the listing shape at publish by design, so the spec's
"rejected at publication" sentence was reattributed to the storefront codec and
the dry run.

## 6. Distribution and aggregate targets

- [x] 6.1 `domains/Makefile`: `dist-inference-domain` (wheel into `$(DIST_DIR)`
      with the `py3-none-any` assertion the other domain targets carry) and
      `test-inference`; add both to the `dist` and `test` aggregates.
- [x] 6.2 Root `Makefile`: `test-inference` delegating to `domains`, added to
      the root `test` aggregate so the aggregate contract stays complete
      coverage.
- [x] 6.3 `domains/inference/tests/test_distribution.py` and
      `test_distribution_install.py` on the API-credits pattern: the wheel
      carries every module; no `[tool.uv.sources]` editable override anywhere
      under `domains/inference/`; the contract imports from the built wheel in a
      clean environment and `market_domain().identity == "inference.v1"`.
- [x] 6.4 Run `make dist-domains` and `make test-inference` from a clean `.dist`
      and record the result.
- [x] 6.5 `.github/workflows/tests.yml`: an `inference-domain` matrix row with
      `predist` and `no_editable`, needing no hosted artifact, so the job can pass
      on a fork pull request.
- [x] 6.6 `make check-reinit` passes for the new project's `reinit` target.

Done 2026-09-27: `domains/inference/Makefile`, `dist-inference-domain` and
`test-inference` in the domain and root aggregates, the wheel fixture with
structural and install tests; `make test-inference` from the root: 136 passed.

## 7. Decision gates

- [x] 7.1 **Decision gate — `model_id` naming authority.** Decided
      2026-09-21 as a domain-owned canonical format; **revised 2026-09-24** on
      review and recorded in `design.md`, "Model identity is seller-asserted and
      convergent": the seller asserts `model_id`; the domain ships a derivation
      rule as a pure function and the spec says a listing SHOULD use it; the
      domain keeps no model list; a registry operator may make the rule a MUST
      for their registry through the filter specification and the registry
      never mints, resolves, or aliases identifiers; `quantization` is an
      enumerated field; a required, filterable `provenance` states
      `self-hosted` or `resold`, and resale is legitimate; an optional
      `model_owner` principal is the three-party hook, with no royalty field;
      `deployment_id` was rejected as a second name for `listing_id`. Sections
      1.3, 1.3a, 1.5, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 carry the resulting work.
- [x] 7.2 **Decision gate — credit denomination.** Decided 2026-09-24 and
      recorded in `design.md`, "One pricing layer": one credit is one base unit
      of the listing's settlement asset, the settlement option's per-credit rate
      is exactly one, `quantity` is base units purchased, and rate-card integers
      are prices in that asset. The alternative — an abstract credit each seller
      denominates — was rejected because it makes rate filters compare unlike
      units. Sections 2.1–2.3 and 5.2 carry the resulting work; the rate-bound
      pairing is a declared co-requirement in the filter specification.

## 8. Closeout

- [x] 8.1 **Comment hygiene.** Run `make check-comment-hygiene` and resolve every
      match. Read the copied modules directly for references to the API-credits
      change history their docstrings may have carried across.
- [x] 8.2 **Import placement.** Review imports this change adds; move
      function-level imports to module level where no genuine circular import or
      documented lazy-load reason applies, verified against the suite.
- [ ] 8.3 **Documentation compliance.** Pending post-review promotion: the
      `inference` capability's `spec.md` and `architecture.md` are created when
      the delta is synchronized at archival, per `AGENTS.md`'s rule that
      promotion follows code review. Re-check accepted decisions against
      `openspec/README.md`'s placement rules; confirm the domain-versus-extension
      rationale and the copy-first rule landed in
      the `inference` capability's `architecture.md` and the normative statements in
      the `inference` capability's `spec.md`, not only here.
- [x] 8.4 **Narrative compression.** Compress completed-task notes to final
      behavior, validation evidence, and promotion destinations; keep rejected
      alternatives in `design.md`.
- [x] 8.5 **Roadmap currency.** Update Goal 8's current-state prose in
      `docs/development/ROADMAP.md` (the vocabulary now exists) and remove this
      change's row from its gap table; name the update in the promotion record.
- [x] 8.6 **Campaign index currency.** Update this change's row and the
      campaign graph in `openspec/changes/README.md`; confirm every campaign
      link resolves to an existing directory.
- [x] 8.7 **Documentation citations.** Run
      `make check-doc-citations CHANGE=add-inference-domain-contract` and resolve
      every match.
- [ ] 8.8 **End-to-end pipeline.** Not run locally: the development stack
      runs under amd64 emulation on this host, which the seller quickstart
      records as unsuitable for validation. This change adds no service and no
      scenario; the registry integration suite and an image build ran green,
      and the fork pull request's CI runs the new matrix job. The nightly
      pipeline on `dev` remains the regression check for the unchanged services.
      Treat the pipeline's validations as unrun until that run is recorded. This change adds no service and no scenario,
      so the existing pipeline is the regression check: run
      `make -C e2e-tests test-e2e` on the branch and record that the compute
      and API-credits scenarios are unaffected. If the pipeline cannot run for a
      reason unrelated to this change, record the blocker and the owning change.
- [ ] 8.9 **Promotion.** The record below is complete; the destination
      documents are written at archival, after review. Complete the design-promotion record below, last.

## Design promotion record

| Accepted decision | Permanent location |
|---|---|
| The domain owns the shapes a buyer compares on — model card, rate card, usage record — not what a storefront sells or charges; the payment kit converts money, the storefront prices its balance, and a registry operator decides comparability | the `inference` capability's `architecture.md` — "Market shape"; one sentence in `openspec/specs/api-credits/architecture.md` — "Market shape" |
| One listing is one served model | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "One listing is one served model" |
| One credit is one base unit of the settlement asset; the settlement rate is one; rate-card integers are prices in that asset | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "Purchase is priced in settlement-asset base units", "Rate card is integer-valued and pinned at issuance"; rationale in its `architecture.md` |
| The rate card is pinned at issuance | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "Rate card is integer-valued and pinned at issuance" |
| The request charge is added to the ceiling of the token sum; a failed upstream costs nothing | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "Usage record and deterministic charge derivation" |
| A malformed card is refused by the storefront's codec and the registry's dry run; a registry's publish boundary refuses only retired spellings | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "One listing is one served model" |
| Charge derivation is a pure function of record and card | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "Usage record and deterministic charge derivation" |
| Usage evidence is secret-free | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "Usage evidence is secret-free" |
| Three identities; the bearer credential is delivery | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "Bearer credential is delivery, not identity or payment authority" |
| The authority is the singular synchronous admission decision; rating systems are downstream | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "Admission authority is synchronous and singular"; rationale in the `inference` capability's `architecture.md` |
| Discovery under the `inference` schema identity | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "Discovery under the inference schema identity" |
| Quota-backed publication in version 1 as the backed value of the declared backing property, quota being a sales cap | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "Quota-backed publication"; trigger in the `inference` capability's `architecture.md` — "Current limits" |
| No derived discovery price; a rate bound co-requires its settlement asset in the filter specification, so the registry refuses an unpaired bound | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "Discovery under the inference schema identity"; `architecture.md` — "Current limits" |
| Attestation is reserved as an opaque envelope on the card and the evidence, unverified and unfilterable in this version | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "Attestation is reserved and unverified"; rationale in its `architecture.md` |
| Copies are frozen and extraction blocks metering | `docs/development/ROADMAP.md` Goal 8 current state; the campaign section of `openspec/changes/README.md` |
| Copy first, extract after two consumers | the `inference` capability's `architecture.md` — "Implementation composition"; `docs/development/ROADMAP.md` Goal 8 current state |
| `inference` joins the enumerated offering modes; **rate card** and **usage record** join the Terms table | `docs/development/ARCHITECTURE.md` — "One name per concept", "Terms" |
| Model identity is seller-asserted with a SHOULD derivation rule; the domain keeps no model list; quantization is an enumerated field; provenance is required and resale legitimate; a registry may curate but never mints; `model_owner` is the three-party hook with no royalty field | the `inference` capability's `spec.md` — "One listing is one served model"; rationale in its `architecture.md` |
